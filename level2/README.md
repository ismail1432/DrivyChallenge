# Intro

We are building a peer-to-peer car rental service. Let's call it Drivy :)

Here is our plan:
- let any car owner list her car on our platform
- let any person (let's call her 'driver') book a car for given dates/distance


# Level 2

To be as competitive as possible, we decide to have a decreasing pricing for longer rentals.

New rules:

price per day decreases by 10% after 1 day
price per day decreases by 30% after 4 days
price per day decreases by 50% after 10 days
Adapt the rental price computation to take these new rules into account

Write code that generates `output.json` from `data.json`
